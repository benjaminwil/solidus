# Product stock

You can manage whether products and variants are in stock in the Solidus backend
interface. When you are editing a product, select the **Product Stock** tab to
manage stock for that product.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of product stock tab's interface. -->

The **Product Stock** tab provides a view of the current product's stock.
However, it uses the same interface as the Solidus backend's **Stock** section
if you prefer to view multiple products at once.

For more information about how stock is managed, see the [Stock][stock-overview]
documentation.

<!-- TODO: Add link to variants article once it is merged. -->
